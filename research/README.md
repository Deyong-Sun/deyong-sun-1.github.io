Here are my current and prevous research projects. During my MSc experience, the research focus on Isogeometric Boundary Element Method (IGABEM) and 
its applications for composite materials, including shape optimization, viscoelastic analysis, elastic energy increment.

## Isogeometric Shape Optimization
---------
<img align="right" width="380" height="180" src="https://deyong-sun.github.io/assets/img/research/shape optimization.png"/>
* The isogeometric boundary element method (IGABEM) is used to optimize the shape of heterogeneous material;
* The power series expansion method (PSEM) is applied to IGABEM to evaluate various degrees of singularity about sensitivity analysis
* Published Paper: [PDF](/assets/img/research/1-s2.0-S0045782520304643-main.pdf)
* Code: [Matlab for 2D Isogeometric Shape Optimization]{:.heading.flip-title}

## Isogeometric Viscoelastic Analysis
--------
<img align="right" width="300" height="180" src="https://deyong-sun.github.io/assets/img/research/viscoelastic analysis.png"/>
* Viscoelasti analysis method based on IGABEM is provided;
* Multi-inclusion example is used to verfy the accuracy of this method;
